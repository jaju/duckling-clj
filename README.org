* Duckling?

A Clojure library originally created by [[https://wit.ai/][Wit.ai]] for identifying semantic content in text - like time, measurements, currencies and similar.

*Wit.ai* decided to abandon the Clojure version in favour of a [[https://github.com/facebook/duckling][Haskell version]].

* Details

[[https://clojars.org/org.msync/duckling][file:https://clojars.org/org.msync/duckling/latest-version.svg]]

/org.msync/duckling-clj/ is a Clojure library that parses text into structured data:

#+begin_src clojure
  (parse "the first Tuesday of October")
  ; =>
  {:value "2014-10-07T00:00:00.000-07:00"
   :grain :day}
#+end_src

For the time the hosted Clojure version by *wit.ai* exists, you can try it out at https://duckling.wit.ai

The original blog post announcement can be found at [[https://wit.ai/blog/2014/10/01/open-source-parser-duckling][https://wit.ai/blog/2014/10/01/open-source-parser-duckling]] for more context.

** Getting started

To use Duckling in your project, you just need two functions: `load!` to load the default configuration, and `parse` to
parse a string.

#+begin_src clojure
  (ns myproject.core
    (:require [duckling.core :as p]))

  (p/load!) ;; Load all languages

  (p/parse :en$core ;; core configuration for English ; see also :fr$core, :es$core, :zh$core
           "wake me up the last Monday of January 2015 at 6am"
           [:time]) ;; We are interested in :time expressions only ; see also :duration, :temperature, etc.

  ;; => [{:label :time
  ;;        :start 15
  ;;        :end 49
  ;;        :value {:type "value", :value "2015-01-26T06:00:00.000-02:00", :grain :hour}
  ;;        :body "last Monday of January 2015 at 6am"}]
#+end_src
